I am a first year student at University of Essex currently studying Computer Games. My main area of interest is coding/programming, specifically developing application software that aims to encourage people to feel and live with purpose in their daily lives. Additionally I am also keen on exploring the stock market, learning about investment and enhancing my knowledge in this field. I recently changed my career pathways after carrying out an extensive research on my strengths, weaknesses and passion. I have held a few positions in IT strengthening my IT skills now looking on for a more challenging role to challenge my skills.
